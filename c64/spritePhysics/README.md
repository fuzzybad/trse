SpritePhysics demo
==================

This is an example of converting a C64 BASIC program to Turbo Rascal (TRSE).

Notes:
------
Notes regarding BASIC to TRSE process can be found at media/sprite%20physics%20notes.txt


Binaries: 
---------
Located under bin/ folder. 
A D64 file containing original BASIC PRG and both ML versions can be found at bin/spritephysics.d64


Source Files:
-------------
"spritep - v1.ras" - First step in conversion process.  Empty TRSE project with BASIC source in comment lines.

"spritep - v2.ras" - Second step in process.  Functions have been defined with the relevant BASIC lines.

"spritep - v3.ras" = Third step in proces.  BASIC lines have (mostly) been converted to TRSE code.

"spritep - lines" - Final version.  Implements fractional values & several improvements over original BASIC program.
